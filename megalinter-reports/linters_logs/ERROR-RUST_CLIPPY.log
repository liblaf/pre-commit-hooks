Linter raw log:

error: failed to select a version for `libgit2-sys`.
    ... required by package `git2 v0.18.2`
    ... which satisfies dependency `git2 = "^0.18.2"` of package `shadow-rs v0.27.1`
    ... which satisfies dependency `shadow-rs = "^0.27.1"` of package `cli v0.0.0 (https://github.com/liblaf/rust-cli.git#6cb84369)`
    ... which satisfies git dependency `cli` (locked to 0.0.0) of package `liblaf-pre-commit-hooks v0.1.2 (/github/workspace)`
versions that meet the requirements `^0.16.2` are: 0.16.2+1.7.2

the package `libgit2-sys` links to the native library `git2`, but it conflicts with a previous package which links to `git2` as well:
package `libgit2-sys v0.17.0+1.8.1`
    ... which satisfies dependency `libgit2-sys = "^0.17.0"` of package `git2 v0.19.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `git2 = "^0.19.0"` of package `shadow-rs v0.35.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `shadow-rs = "^0.35.0"` of package `liblaf-pre-commit-hooks v0.1.2 (/github/workspace)`
Only one package in the dependency graph may specify the same links value. This helps ensure that only one copy of a native library is linked in the final binary. Try to adjust your dependencies so that only one package uses the `links = "git2"` value. For more information, see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#links.
